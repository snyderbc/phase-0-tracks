<!--HTML5 semantic tags help to break the page into recognizable sections, which we can then add styling to later on. Helps a lot with navigation, adding context to each block of code. The browser displays from top to bottom, as indicated by the html/CSS. I learned that it's possible create my own snippets in Sublime, which are essentially shortcuts to create frequent blocks of code. The hardest part of the challenge was actually creating the snippet, since that was brand new to me. But it should just take some practice!-->
