Release 0: Equip Your New Robot (Elevator)

- Move forward until you are within one foot of the elevator call panel, which contains an arrow pointing up and an error pointing down
   - If your destination floor number is greater than your current floor, press the up arrow.
   - Otherwise, press the down arrow.
- Stand patiently until the elevator arrives, indicated by a ding and a door opening
- Enter the open elevator door, and scan the elevator walls until you locate a panel with numbered buttons
- Look at the first number in the left corner of the list
  - If the number is equal to your destination number, push the numbered button until it is highlighted
  - If it does not equal your destination number, continue to the next number on the list until you find the number equal to your destination number.
    - There may be multiple lists - once one column is finished, move to the top of the next column.
- When the elevator stops moving and the door opens:
  - Check to see if the floor is equal to your floor destination (floors are typically labeled)
    - If it is not equal: stay on the elevator and wait patiently
    - If it is equal: exit the elevator through the open door and do a well-earned victory dance
