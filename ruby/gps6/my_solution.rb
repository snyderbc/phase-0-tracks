# Virus Predictor

# I worked on this challenge with Anica for around 2 hours, and then started over from scratch to get more practice by myself. That took me XXX hours.


# EXPLANATION OF require_relative
#It is essentially grabbing the code from the designated file, which is stored in the same folder (hence the relative). It's equivalent to copying and pasting the code into our program.
