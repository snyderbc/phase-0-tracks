What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?
That the user of the operating system would be computer literate - basically know what they're doing from the start (as opposed to Mac & Windows - which shield the user). It gives users a lot of power - to create really great things, but also to do damage!

It is easy to access the CLI, it executes commands without checking to ensure you really want to, and ultimately gives the user access to powerful tools.


In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A virtual private server basically creates a virtual computer, or entity that allows you to store data and access that data without it having to be on a physical device. They run their own copy of an operating system. It is often more afforable than a physical server, plus they are a lot easier/faster to set up. Only downside is performance may be lower, as they physical aspect is shared and can vary based on how other executing virtual machines are operating.


Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
It's bad for security. You generally want to give only certain people administrative access - or you can do damage to your underlying system.
