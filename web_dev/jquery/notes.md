Google "jQuery" and start by reading a couple overviews of what exactly jQuery is, and why it's used. Also google other JavaScript libraries, to get a feel for how those work in general - and what is unique to jQuery. When is it appropriate to use, and when is it not? During this research phase - google other terms you might not be familiar with as well.

Find the official jQuery documentation.

Find a couple jQuery cheat sheets, to bookmark for later reference.

Take a quick break if my brain is getting tired :)

Find a couple training guides, and walk through some of the basic intro exercises.

Experiment on my own, creating a file to play with and tinkering until time is up - googling when I get stuck.

Most Effective Strategies:
It was good to start with some beginner-focused overviews, before trying to dive into the official documentation (which can often be a little over my head). I also liked getting a general overview from multiple places - it helped lay the foundation and each site took a slightly different approach. Once I had a general understanding, it was helpful to experiment with a few different tutorials, and then choose one to do a deeper dive. There are so many amazing free online courses out there - and the one I settled on had some great challenges built in that allowed me to actually practice creating and running the code.
