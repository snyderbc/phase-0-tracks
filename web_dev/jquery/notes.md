Google "jQuery" and start by reading a couple overviews of what exactly jQuery is, and why it's used. Also google other JavaScript libraries, to get a feel for how those work in general - and what is unique to jQuery. When is it appropriate to use, and when is it not? During this research phase - google other terms you might not be familiar with as well.

Find the official jQuery documentation.

Find a couple jQuery cheat sheets, to bookmark for later reference.

Take a quick break if my brain is getting tired :)

Find a couple training guides, and walk through some of the basic intro exercises.

Experiment on my own, creating a file to play with and tinkering until time is up - googling when I get stuck.
